# ts-unit-tests-solutions

TypeScript project using Vite for rapid development. Unit tests are written in TypeScript and run with Vitest. Test coverage metrics are included to ensure code quality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js (version 18+ or 20+) installed on your machine. You may use something like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Installation

Run `npm install` to install the required packages.

### Running Tests

To execute your tests, run `npm test`.

To run tests and generate a coverage report, run `npm run coverage`. This will run your tests and provide a coverage report showing how much of your code is tested.

### Running the Project

To start the Vite development server, run `npm run dev`. It allows you to develop your application with hot module replacement.
